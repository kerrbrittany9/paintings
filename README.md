# Painting Portfolio for Brittany Megan Hardison

### To Do:

- Styling for links in sidebar menu (size & color)
- Make navbar Link components separate from gallery link components
- organize file structure
  - i.e. `<Header /> <Body> <Content1 /><Content2 /></Body>`
- within gallery, separate links (so you can click through)...
  - right now you can only click through to drawings
- when you click a nav-link, the sidebar menu should collapse
- narrow down click-area for gallery links
- make the app response with media-queries
